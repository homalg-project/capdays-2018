### Wednesday: CAP Tutorial & Coding Sprint

#### CAP Tutorial in Room D-221:
* 10:00 - 13:00: First steps in CAP: Implementing a basic group and vector space category
In this tutorial you will learn how to implement a basic category in CAP.
We will start by using preexistent data structures for finite groups in GAP to implement a CAP category.
Afterwards, we will implement the abelian category of finite dimensional vector spaces over a constructive field
in CAP.

* 14:00 - 17:00: Advanced: Computing with generalized morphisms, implementing the snake lemma and computing parts of spectral sequences
In this tutorial we will use the abelian category of vector spaces we implemented in the morning
to explore the computational features of CAP and write algorithms in CAP's categorical programming language.
We will learn about a significant feature of CAP, the generalized morphisms.
Afterwards, we will learn how to use CAP's categorical programming language and
the generalized morphisms to implement the snake lemma and compute parts of spectral sequences.
