## Workshop
* Start: Tuesday August 28th 2018 at 09:50
* Finish: Friday August 31st 2018 15:30

### Tuesday: CAP Symposium with CAP related talks in Room D-212

* 09:50 - 10:00: Welcome
* 10:00 - 12:00: Gutsche/Posur: *Introduction to CAP: Constructive category theory and applications*<br/>
> **Abstract:** In this talk we explain the concept of constructive category theory
> and its implementation in our software project
> CAP - Categories, algorithms, programming.
> Furthermore, we show the benefits of CAP's framework
> for constructive category theory
> by demonstrating
> some applications to homological algebra:
> diagram chasing via generalized morphisms
> and computing the purity filtration via spectral sequences.
* 12:00 - 13:00: Lunch
* 13:00 - 13:40: Skartsæterhagen: *CAP in QPA*
* 14:00 - 14:40: Bies: *CAP, machine learning and string theory*
* 15:00 - 15:30: Coffee and cake
* 15:30 - 16:10: Juteau: *TBA*
* 16:30 - 17:10: Saleh: *Implementation of Quillen model categories*
> **Abstract:** This talk is meant to introduce the Quillen model
> categories. In short, model categories are used to give an effective
> construction of the localization of categories, where, similarly to localization of rings,
> the problem is to convert a class of morphisms, called weak-equivalences, into isomorphisms.
> 
> In the case of a model category, the localized category is identified with a homotopy category, a category
> whose morphism sets consist of equivalence classes of morphisms under a certain
> homotopy relation which is determined by the model structure.
> 
> We demonstrate this by constructing in Gap/CAP the derived category of some categories with finite global projective dimension,
> for example the category of finite left presentations over a polynomial ring or the category of representations of an acyclic
> quiver. 

### Wednesday: CAP Tutorial & Coding Sprint

#### CAP Tutorial in Room D-212

To prepare your computer for the tutorials, follow the instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/preparation).

* 10:00 - 13:00: *Computing with CAP*<br/>
In this tutorial we will show how to use CAP for (advanced) computations in homological algebra.
This includes computing with modules in CAP, and using CAP as as a categorical programming language.


* 14:00 - 17:00: *Implementing your own category*<br/>
In this tutorial you will learn how to implement a basic category in CAP.
We will start by using preexistent data structures for finite groups in GAP to implement a CAP category.
Afterwards, we will implement the abelian category of finite dimensional vector spaces over a constructive field
in CAP.
